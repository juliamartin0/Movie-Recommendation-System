# Movie Recommendation: A Comprehensive Overview

Movie recommendation is a cornerstone of today's entertainment industry. Platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney + leverage recommendation systems to suggest movies/shows to their users, enhancing user experience and satisfaction. However, developing an effective recommendation system presents several challenges. 

- Data Volume: Streaming platforms possess vast catalogs of movies and millions of users. Processing and analyzing such massive data demands specialized techniques and tools.
- Data Heterogeneity: Movie reviews can vary significantly in style, length, and vocabulary, making analysis challenging.
- Personalization: each user has unique tastes and preferences, so a recommendation system must adapt to individual user needs.

The primary goal of this project is to develop a movie recommendation system based on the analysis of user reviews. This system aims to:

- Personalize recommendations: suggest movies tailored to each user's tastes and preferences.
- Discover new movies: help users find movies they might not have considered otherwise.
- Enhance user experience: increase user satisfaction by providing relevant and personalized recommendations.

The dataset used for this project was MovieLens Dataset, a widely used resource in recommendation system research. MovieLens provides information on movie ratings, reviews, tags and movie links. The full dataset contains over 33 million reviews, but for educational and development purposes, I decided to work with their smaller version of the dataset (100k reviews).
